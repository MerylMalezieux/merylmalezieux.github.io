I am a systems neuroscientist passionate about brain-body interactions and interoception. 

For decades (centuries?), neuroscientists have studied the brain entirely in isolation from the body it is attached to. 
However, we all know how much the way we feel inside can impact our judgement, mood or emotions. In the common language, we often use bodily sensations as a way to describe emotions: "my heart started racing", "I felt butterflies in my stomach", "I had an instant gut feeling", "she was breathtaking"... 

My research aim to enravel how, when and why bodily signals influence brain activity, and the mechanisms the brain use to precisely control and regulate these signals, in health and disease.
